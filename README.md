# 🔍 Blockchain Analysis

Comprehensive on-chain investigation and data analysis of blockchain activities using SQL, data visualization tools, and decentralized analytics platforms. This project showcases my capability in uncovering transactional patterns, tracing illicit flows, and presenting insights in a clear, visual format.

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains analytical work done on blockchain transaction datasets. The primary goal is to investigate wallet behaviors, token flows, and unusual patterns—ranging from market manipulation to money laundering techniques—using publicly available blockchain data.

## 🧠 Key Highlights

- ✅ Identified suspicious wallet clusters using heuristic-based labeling
- ✅ Tracked token movement through complex swap and bridging routes
- ✅ Analyzed NFT flip activity and staking behaviors across protocols
- ✅ Created dashboards and reports for community and grant bounties
